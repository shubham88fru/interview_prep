- questions to ask
  - Weight limit on elevators?
  - Any requirement around wait time etc.

- issues:
  - doesn't take into consideration the current state of the lift - if it moving, stopped etc.
  - When finding a lift, the current algorithm simply checks the smallest distance of the lift 
    but doesn't see which direction is the lift moving in.
  - each elevator has same capacity, can be made custom for each elevator.
